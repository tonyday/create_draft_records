## Challenge
. To conduct some testing we needed to duplicate the `Order` and `OrderLine` records associated to a given Customer and mark them as "draft"
. The volume of associated records (several hundred thousands) meant that using Rails ActiveRecord would have been prohibitively slow.

## Models
Please note that the model names have been changed from the original problem domain.

```ruby
class Customer < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :orders
end

class Order < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :customer
  has_many :order_lines
end

class OrderLine < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :order
end
```

## Solution
Given that the volume of records would have made a "row at a time" approach unusably slow we chose to try an `SQL` based "bulk insert" approach.

### Initial problem with using SQL

If we only needed to copy the `orders` records it would have been straightforward using something like the following (most columns omitted for brevity)

```SQL
INSERT INTO orders
( customer_id
, draft)
SELECT customer_id
     , true AS draft
FROM orders
WHERE customer_id = 1
;
```


However, the challenge when using `SQL` was trying to figure out how to populate `order_id` when copying related `order_lines` records.

### Proposed approach

. Retrieve the maximum `id` from `orders`
+
```SQL
select MAX(id) AS MAX_ORDER_ID
from orders
;

```

. When copying `orders` records explicitly set the `id` using the original value plus `MAX_ORDER_ID`
+
```SQL
INSERT INTO orders
( id
, customer_id
, draft)
SELECT id + MAX_ORDER_ID
     , customer_id
     , true AS draft
FROM orders
WHERE customer_id = 1
;
```

. When copying `order_lines` records set the `order_id` using the original value plus `MAX_ORDER_ID`
+
```SQL
INSERT INTO order_lines
    (order_id)
SELECT order_id + MAX_ORDER_ID AS order_id
FROM order_lines
WHERE order_id IN (SELECT id
                   FROM orders
                   WHERE customer_id = 1 AND draft = false)
;

```

### Outcome
* We were able to duplicate the required records very quickly (sub 10 seconds for all records).
* While not "production ready" the approach that we took addressed the requirement we had (with regard to testing) and was both quick to develop and execute.
